PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Uber ride prices are not constant like public transport. They are gently affected by the demand and supply of rides at a given time. 

Literature Review: What exactly drives this demand? The first guess would be the time of the day; times around 9 am and 5 pm should seems the highest surges on account of people commuting to work/home.

An Another guess might be the increase of price due to the change of weather conditions.
